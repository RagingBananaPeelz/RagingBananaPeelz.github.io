# Critical Response to the Allegations Against the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)

The recent uproar over alleged irregularities and victimization within the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) demands a measured and evidence-based response, especially given the commission's strategic importance to Nigeria's digital and economic advancement.

## Upholding Due Process and Merit

First and foremost, the Commission has clearly reiterated its adherence to due process in the conduct of the recent promotion exercises. In line with the Public Service Rules, promotions were based on defined manpower needs, available vacancies, and established merit thresholds. As stated by the Acting Head of Public Affairs, no staff who failed to meet the cutoff mark or for whom vacancies were unavailable could be promoted. This is a fundamental HR practice and in no way amounts to suppression or favouritism.

In fact, each interview panel was made up of representatives from all six geopolitical zones, along with independent observers and the Federal Character Commission (FCC)—a fact that underscores the transparency of the process and the NCC's commitment to fairness and national balance.

## False Alarm and Selective Memory

It is important to note that many of those who are today making noise about "marginalization" were silent when, under a past administration, internal vacancies were brazenly allocated to one section of the country. Promotions and strategic roles then were tilted in favour of staff from specific geopolitical zones, and not a single protest or statement was issued by today's so-called "concerned staff." If equity and fairness are truly the concern, where were their voices then?

This points to a selective outrage driven not by a desire for reform but by personal interest or loss of influence in the current structure.

## Promotion Process: Transparent and Interactive

The Commission has gone further than many government agencies by giving candidates the opportunity to choose their presentation topics and appear before panels of professionals who appraised them on merit. This participatory and competency-based model is a global best practice. While the late hours of the exam process are regrettable—and for which management duly apologized—it must be seen in context: a logistical issue, not a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise anyone.

## On the Allegation of Victimization

There is no evidence of systemic victimization within the Commission. However, discipline must be upheld in any functional institution. Where staff make unsubstantiated claims, leak internal information maliciously, or willfully distort facts to cause disaffection, such individuals must be held accountable. That is not victimization—it is governance.

Making noise or granting press interviews does not equate to intelligence or patriotism. Constructive criticism is welcome, but weaponizing grievances without facts is dangerous and unethical.

## Context of Resource Constraints

This administration has been open with staff about the challenge of limited funding and the top-heavy structure of the Commission. Staff have been advised to consider vacancies and structural limits before expecting automatic elevation. Promotions are not entitlements—they are earned, planned, and based on capacity to absorb.

## Final Thoughts

The NCC remains one of Nigeria's most respected regulatory agencies. While no organization is perfect, this administration has made strides toward merit, fiscal responsibility, and institutional integrity. The call for President Tinubu to intervene should be based on balanced facts, not orchestrated propaganda. What the NCC needs is focus, reform, and support—not internal sabotage disguised as advocacy.

If anyone has genuine claims, the appropriate internal mechanisms exist to investigate and resolve them. But unverified accusations in the media only undermine public trust and derail progress.

Let the truth stand. Let professionalism lead. Let the NCC continue to serve Nigeria with pride.
