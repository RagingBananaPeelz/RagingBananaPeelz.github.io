# NCC Stands Firm on Merit-Based Promotion Process

The **Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)** has issued a comprehensive response to recent allegations surrounding its promotion exercises, strongly defending its adherence to established **due process** and **merit-based selection criteria**.

## Due Process and Merit: The Foundation of NCC Promotions

The Commission has categorically reiterated its commitment to following **Public Service Rules** in conducting recent promotion exercises. According to the Acting Head of Public Affairs, all promotions were strictly based on:

### Key Selection Criteria:
- **Defined manpower needs** within the organization
- **Available vacancies** across departments
- **Established merit thresholds** for each position level
- Performance assessments and competency evaluations

The NCC emphasized that no staff member who failed to meet the established cutoff marks or for whom vacancies were unavailable could be promoted—a standard HR practice that ensures organizational efficiency and fairness.

## Transparent Panel Composition Ensures National Balance

To address concerns about fairness and representation, the Commission highlighted the comprehensive composition of its interview panels:

### Panel Structure:
- **Representatives from all six geopolitical zones**
- **Independent observers** to ensure objectivity
- **Federal Character Commission (FCC)** participation
- Professional assessors from various departments

This structure demonstrates the NCC's commitment to **national balance** and **transparent evaluation processes**, ensuring no single region or group dominates the selection process.

## Addressing Claims of Historical Inconsistency

The Commission has drawn attention to what it describes as "selective memory" among current critics, pointing out that many staff members now raising concerns about marginalization remained silent during previous administrations when:

### Past Administrative Concerns:
- Internal vacancies were allegedly allocated to specific regions
- Promotions favored staff from particular geopolitical zones
- Strategic roles were distributed without proper balance
- No formal protests were recorded from current complainants

This historical context, according to NCC management, suggests that current objections may be **"driven by personal interest or loss of influence"** rather than genuine concern for equity.

## Competency-Based Assessment Model

The NCC has implemented what it describes as a **global best practice** approach to promotions, featuring:

### Assessment Features:
- **Candidate choice of presentation topics**
- **Professional panel evaluations** based on merit
- **Participatory and competency-based model**
- Interactive assessment sessions

While acknowledging that **late examination hours were regrettable**—for which management formally apologized—the Commission characterized this as a **logistical issue** rather than deliberate disenfranchisement.

## Discipline vs. Victimization: Drawing the Line

Responding to allegations of systematic victimization, the NCC maintained that no evidence supports such claims while emphasizing the importance of institutional discipline.

### Disciplinary Standards:
- Accountability for **unsubstantiated claims**
- Action against **malicious information leaks**
- Response to **willful fact distortion**
- Maintenance of **professional standards**

The Commission stressed that holding staff accountable for such actions constitutes **governance, not victimization**.

## Resource Constraints and Realistic Expectations

The current NCC administration has been transparent about operational challenges, including:

### Organizational Challenges:
- **Limited funding availability**
- **Top-heavy organizational structure**
- **Capacity absorption limitations**
- Need for **structural reforms**

Staff have been advised to consider these constraints when anticipating promotions, with management emphasizing that **"promotions are not entitlements—they are earned, planned, and based on capacity to absorb."**

## NCC's Reputation and Reform Efforts

Despite current controversies, the Commission maintains its position as **one of Nigeria's most respected regulatory agencies**. The current administration highlights its achievements in:

### Reform Initiatives:
- **Merit-based selection processes**
- **Fiscal responsibility measures**
- **Institutional integrity improvements**
- **Transparent governance practices**

## Moving Forward: Call for Constructive Engagement

The NCC has emphasized that while **constructive criticism is welcome**, it strongly opposes what it terms **"weaponizing grievances without facts."** The Commission calls for:

### Recommended Approach:
- Use of **internal mechanisms** for genuine complaints
- **Fact-based discussions** rather than media campaigns
- **Professional conduct** in addressing concerns
- **Support for institutional progress**

## What This Means for NCC's Future

The controversy highlights broader challenges facing Nigeria's public institutions as they balance **traditional expectations** with **modern governance standards**. The NCC's stance suggests a commitment to:

- Maintaining **professional standards** despite internal resistance
- Implementing **transparent processes** even when controversial
- Balancing **regional representation** with merit-based selection
- **Institutional reform** over status quo maintenance

## Industry Implications

The outcome of this internal dispute could influence how other Nigerian regulatory agencies approach:
- Staff promotion processes
- Transparency in government operations
- Balance between traditional considerations and merit
- Management of internal dissent and reform initiatives

The NCC's handling of these allegations will likely serve as a benchmark for other public institutions navigating similar challenges between traditional practices and modern governance expectations.
