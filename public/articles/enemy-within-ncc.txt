# The Enemy Within: How Internal Forces Are Undermining the NCC

As an interested party who has followed developments at the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) closely, I feel compelled to respond to certain media outlets—most notably **Sahara Reporters**—publishing alarming claims of fear, intimidation, and victimization within the organization. These claims are deeply misleading and fail to reflect the transparent and merit-based culture that defines the NCC.

As an investigative journalist of thirty (30) years covering the public sector, it is unthinkable to suggest that the Commission disregards federal character or deliberately sidelines certain zones during the 2025 promotion exercise. This assertion is both unfair and unfounded.

Promotions at the NCC—with its established culture of professionalism—are earned, not gifted. They are based on objective performance metrics and the outcome of standardized assessments. The fact that some individuals from specific zones did not make promotion lists is not evidence of bias—it is simply a reflection of the results. **Merit must come first.**

## A Grounded Investigation

The writer conducted a thorough investigation, consulting credible sources and interviewing over **fifty staff**—including directorate level, middle management, and line/junior level staff—who participated in the 2025 staff promotion exercise. This inquiry was launched to verify the allegations of bias, intimidation, and victimization made by certain employees.

Our discreet investigation revealed that these claims were **fabricated**, seemingly intended to project an image of instability within the Commission.

For context, a candidate from the **Northwest zone**, coincidentally the same zone as the Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of the Commission, was **not promoted** simply because he failed to meet the required pass mark—even though there was a vacancy in that zone. If there were any agenda to favor certain regions, this would not have happened. This **single example speaks volumes** about the level of fairness and institutional integrity within the Commission.

## The Whistleblower Narrative

Regarding claims about whistleblowers being targeted, it's important for the public to understand that records and testimonies from long-serving staff—and even retirees—indicate that some of these individuals have **questionable histories**.

One of them was reportedly involved in unethical dealings with a previous employer, leaking sensitive documents in exchange for employment opportunities. Despite internal warnings, he was eventually employed—an act of generosity that appears to have been **repaid with sabotage**. That’s a story for another day.

## Reform vs Entitlement

What is now playing out seems less about justice and more about **entitlement**—individuals trying to pressure the system into reversing merit-based outcomes to suit personal ambitions. This is not just unacceptable—it is dangerous.

Many within the Commission have expressed readiness to **defend its core values**, and rightly so. A few individuals cannot and should not be allowed to hold the institution to ransom.

## Undermining Excellence

The NCC has for years stood as a **model of regulatory excellence** in Nigeria and across Africa. Its achievements under the administration of **President Bola Ahmed Tinubu** must not be undermined by **baseless allegations** driven by personal grievances.

Recent media reports—particularly those alleging intimidation, suppression of whistleblowers, and institutional dysfunction—are not only misleading but dangerously attempt to **rewrite the truth** about an agency that has long been held up as a model of regulatory excellence in Africa.

As someone who knows the internal workings of the NCC intimately, I can say with certainty that the Commission has always operated on principles of **merit, transparency, and due process**.

No system is perfect, but to suggest that performance assessments or organizational restructuring amount to **witch-hunts** is a **gross mischaracterization**.

## This is Transformation, Not Crisis

What is happening within the Commission is **not a crisis—it is transformation**.

Change, especially one aimed at improving efficiency and aligning with global best practices, often **unsettles entrenched interests**. Resistance is natural. But when that resistance escalates into **blackmail, misinformation**, and a **coordinated attempt to destabilize** the system, it crosses the line from dissent to **sabotage**.

## The Reform Agenda

Let us be clear: the NCC’s recent reforms are **not about targeting** any group of staff. They are about:

- Raising the bar of performance
- Enforcing accountability
- Preparing the Commission for the future

Claims that long-serving or high-performing individuals are being victimized are **not only false**, they are **insulting** to the many dedicated professionals—past and present—who have built the Commission’s legacy on **hard work and discipline**.

## Media Pressure vs Merit

It is especially worrying to see a few disgruntled individuals—who have failed to meet transparent benchmarks or qualify through fair processes—attempt to **weaponize the media** and manipulate public opinion.

These tactics do not reflect a commitment to justice or reform. They reflect **personal agendas** aimed at disrupting institutional progress.

What seems to be playing out is the classic **tension between reform and entitlement**. A narrow circle of disgruntled staff—having failed to meet performance benchmarks—now seek to **rewrite the narrative** by portraying reform as persecution.

Their chosen weapons?

- Anonymous petitions  
- Unfounded allegations  
- Sensationalist media reports  

This is not whistleblowing. It is **institutional sabotage**, and it must be called out as such.

## Final Thoughts

The NCC is not a place for mediocrity or entitlement. It is a place where **excellence is earned**, not demanded.

I have witnessed first-hand the rigor of its assessments, the fairness of its procedures, and the **integrity of its leadership**. To now watch that integrity come under attack by those unwilling to subject themselves to the same standards is **disheartening**.

More concerning is the **moral hazard** of rewarding noise over merit. If decisions were reversed based on threats, media pressure, or emotional appeals, what message would that send to the many **loyal, hardworking staff** who play by the rules?

It would be a **betrayal** of everything the NCC stands for. Worse still, it would open the door to a culture where **manipulation triumphs over meritocracy**.

Those calling for the reversal of reform outcomes should reflect on the **long-term implications**. Institutions thrive when they uphold their values—even under pressure. They **collapse** when they succumb to internal rebellion masked as righteous indignation.

I urge the current leadership of the NCC:

> **Defend the values. Defend the processes. Defend the institution.**

To the public and media:

> **Beware of the noise of a few trying to disguise self-interest as institutional concern.**

The NCC remains a **world-class institution**. Let us not allow the personal grievances of a minority to distort the reality of an organization that continues to serve Nigeria with **honor and distinction**.
